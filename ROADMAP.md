## üìã Development Guidelines

### For Phase 5 Implementation:

1. **Continue TDD Approach**
   - Write failing tests first
   - Implement minimum viable functionality
   - Refactor with confidence

2. **Maintain Architecture Principles**
   - Abstract interfaces for multi-cloud support
   - Defensive error handling
   - Comprehensive logging and monitoring hooks

3. **Integration Focus**
   - Seamless integration with existing capacity-aware components
   - Preserve existing test coverage
   - Maintain backwards compatibility

4. **Documentation Standards**
   - Update CLAUDE.md with progress
   - Add example scripts for new functionality
   - Document deployment patterns and best practices

### Ready for Next Developer:
- All dependencies installed with UV
- Comprehensive test suite established
- Clear architecture and interfaces defined
- Working demo of capacity-aware planning
- Full TDD workflow established
