# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a multi-cloud free-tier planner project that helps users launch cloud resources within free-tier constraints while avoiding provisioning failures. The project consists of:

- **Constraint Database**: Open-source database of quota and free-tier limits across AWS, GCP, Azure, and OCI
- **Python Planner**: Uses integer linear programming (pulp) to find valid, cost-free deployment plans
- **Live Capacity Detection**: Prevents recommending temporarily unavailable instance shapes
- **Provisioning-Retry Engine**: Repeatedly attempts launch steps until success or timeout

## Architecture Components

The system is organized into these main components:

### âœ… Core Planner (`planner/`)
- **Cost Calculator**: âœ… Tracks usage against free-tier limits
- **Resource Recommender**: âœ… Suggests optimal resource configurations
- **Plan Optimizer**: âœ… Uses cost optimization for deployment plans
- **Capacity-Aware Extensions**: âœ… Enhanced components that consider live capacity
- **Dependencies**: Uses `pulp` (ready), `boto3`/`google-cloud-sdk`/`azure-sdk` for cloud APIs

### âœ… Constraint Database (`constraints/`)
- **Schema**: âœ… YAML files defining free-tier limits per cloud provider
- **Validators**: âœ… Ensure constraint data integrity with Pydantic
- **Query System**: âœ… Fluent interface for constraint filtering
- **Real Data**: âœ… 27+ documented constraints across AWS, GCP, and Azure

### âœ… Capacity Detection (`capacity/`)
- **Live Checkers**: âœ… Real-time availability verification per region/AZ (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Cache Layer**: âœ… TTL-based caching to avoid repeated API calls
- **Aggregation**: âœ… Concurrent capacity checks across multiple providers
- **Integration**: âœ… Seamlessly integrated with planning components

### ðŸš§ Provisioning Engine (`provisioning/`) - NEXT PHASE
- **Cloud Adapters**: Provider-specific provisioning logic
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Exponential backoff and circuit breakers
- **State Management**: Track deployment progress and rollback capability

## Development Setup

This project uses UV for fast, reliable package management:

```bash
# Install dependencies (creates virtual environment automatically)
uv sync

# Install with dev dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Lint and format code
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run black src/ tests/

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/

# Run the planner
uv run sentinel --config config.yaml

# Add new dependencies
uv add package-name
uv add --dev package-name  # for dev dependencies
```

## Project Status & Roadmap

## Key Design Principles

- **Defensive Security**: This tool helps users stay within legitimate free-tier usage
- **Multi-Cloud**: Abstract cloud provider differences behind common interfaces
- **Resilience**: Handle temporary failures and capacity constraints gracefully
- **Transparency**: Clear reporting of what resources will be created and why
- **Test-Driven Development**: All features built using TDD methodology
