# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a multi-cloud free-tier planner project that helps users launch cloud resources within free-tier constraints while avoiding provisioning failures. The project consists of:

- **Constraint Database**: Open-source database of quota and free-tier limits across AWS, GCP, Azure, and OCI
- **Python Planner**: Uses integer linear programming (pulp) to find valid, cost-free deployment plans
- **Live Capacity Detection**: Prevents recommending temporarily unavailable instance shapes
- **Provisioning-Retry Engine**: Repeatedly attempts launch steps until success or timeout
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Cost tracking, health monitoring, and usage analytics
- **Advanced Optimization**: AI-powered algorithms including genetic algorithms and simulated annealing
- **Enterprise Integrations**: CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code export, and API server

## Architecture Components

The system is organized into these main components:

### âœ… Core Planner (`planner/`)
- **Cost Calculator**: âœ… Tracks usage against free-tier limits with overage pricing
- **Resource Recommender**: âœ… Suggests optimal resource configurations with confidence scoring
- **Plan Optimizer**: âœ… Uses cost optimization for deployment plans across multiple providers
- **Capacity-Aware Extensions**: âœ… Enhanced components that consider live capacity data
- **Dependencies**: Uses `pulp` for optimization, cloud SDKs for API integration

### âœ… Constraint Database (`constraints/`)
- **Schema**: âœ… YAML files defining free-tier limits per cloud provider with validation
- **Validators**: âœ… Ensure constraint data integrity with Pydantic v2
- **Query System**: âœ… Fluent interface for constraint filtering with method chaining
- **Real Data**: âœ… 27+ documented constraints across AWS, GCP, and Azure with actual limits

### âœ… Capacity Detection (`capacity/`)
- **Live Checkers**: âœ… Real-time availability verification per region/AZ (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Cache Layer**: âœ… TTL-based caching system to minimize API calls and improve performance
- **Aggregation**: âœ… Concurrent capacity checks across multiple providers using ThreadPoolExecutor
- **Integration**: âœ… Seamlessly integrated with all planning components for capacity awareness

### âœ… Provisioning Engine (`provisioning/`)
- **Cloud Adapters**: âœ… Provider-specific provisioning logic with standardized interfaces
- **Retry Mechanisms**: âœ… Exponential backoff and circuit breakers for resilient deployments
- **State Management**: âœ… Track deployment progress and rollback capability with persistent state

## Development Setup

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/

# Run the planner
uv run sentinel --config config.yaml

# Add new dependencies

- **Health Monitoring**: âœ… Resource health checks with status tracking and alerting
- **Usage Analytics**: âœ… Comprehensive usage reporting with trend analysis and future predictions
- **Dependency Management**: âœ… Resource dependency tracking with deployment order optimization

### âœ… Advanced Features (`monitoring/optimization/`)
- **Genetic Algorithms**: âœ… AI-powered plan optimization using evolutionary algorithms
- **Simulated Annealing**: âœ… Advanced optimization for complex deployment scenarios
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: âœ… Balance cost, performance, and availability constraints

### âœ… Enterprise Integrations (`integration/`)
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: âœ… GitHub Actions workflow generation with automated deployments
- **Infrastructure as Code**: âœ… Export to Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, and Ansible
- **REST API**: âœ… FastAPI-based API server with comprehensive endpoints for all functionality
- **Webhook Notifications**: âœ… Event-driven notifications with HMAC signature verification

- **Multi-Cloud**: Abstract cloud provider differences behind common interfaces
- **Resilience**: Handle temporary failures and capacity constraints gracefully
- **Transparency**: Clear reporting of what resources will be created and why
- **Test-Driven Development**: All features built using TDD methodology (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and enterprise integrations
